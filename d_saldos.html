									<p>The objective of this project is to design a dashboard that allows for the analysis of unsettled balances (reconciliation items) in the accounting information of Colombian entities that are required to report their data through CHIP (Sistema Consolidador de Hacienda e Información Pública - Public Finance and Information Consolidation System). This initiative is part of a broader project aimed at generating transparent and high-quality public information.</p>
									<p>In public accounting, there are reciprocal transactions, meaning that when a public entity issues a sum of money in a specific account, the receiving entity should reflect that same amount in another related accounting account. To detect these reciprocal transactions, certain accounting rules are established, which correspond to different regulated procedures. These rules are based on accounting account correspondences between the issuing and receiving entities.</p>
									<p>In some cases, the rule applies to a single account in both entities; in others, it refers to a set of accounts where the sum must match the sum of accounts in the other entity, or it may establish a one-to-many relationship. Information about these rules, as well as the accounting data used, is publicly available on the website of the General Accounting Office of the Republic of Colombia.</p>

									<h2>Dashboard Description</h2>
									<p>This dashboard is an interactive tool designed to assess unsettled balances according to various elimination rules, categorized by the origin and differences of each rule. The dashboard is divided into four main sections:</p>
									<p>In this step, several processes are generated to clean the text. These processes reduce the number of words that make up the entire universe of documents, which facilitates the automatic search and matching of the terms of interest within the documents.</p>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Evolution of Reconciliation Items:</b> This section displays the evolution of reconciliation items since the second quarter of 2023, both in terms of number and amount. Users can apply filters based on the type of origin-difference and the type of rule.</li>
										<li><b>Structure of Reconciliation Items:</b> In this stage, punctuation marks are removed, numbers are converted to lowercase, and stopwords are removed. Stopwords are words that do not have meaning on their own, such as articles, pronouns, and prepositions, as well as context-specific words that may be very frequent but do not add value. In this case, names of people, municipalities, and departments in Colombia are removed.</li>
										<li><b>Entity Analysis by Reconciliation Item:</b> Users can view the entities with unsettled balances, based on the origin-difference, elimination rule, entity type, or pairs of entity types related to a transaction.</li>
										<li><b>Entity Analysis:</b> This section allows users to analyze the historical behavior of each entity, tracking the evolution of balances under different elimination rules and their behavior in a specific period.</li>
									
									</ol>
									<p>The dashboard is designed for high user interactivity, with a sidebar menu that allows easy navigation between sections. There is also a submenu at the top, just below the title, enabling users to move between subsections within each section. These subsections are structured so that the user begins with a general analysis and progressively focuses on more specific details. Each tab also features buttons that allow users to choose the variable they wish to analyze, such as the number of balances or amounts, and to view them as either charts or tables.</p>
